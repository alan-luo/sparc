		<h1>SPARC 2020 Application</h1>
		<h3>Reflective Question 2B: <span style="font-weight:400">A list of questions.</span></h3>
		<p><b>Written by: </b>Alan Luo</p>

		<p><b>Confession:</b> Some of these have sub-questions. But personally, I think they're in the spirit of the prompt. Sorry if you don't agree.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Where do birds go when it rains? And how can they still fly?</li>
			<li>Why do leaves always seem to float up in spirals in autumn? Why don't they ever just fly straight?</li>
			<li>Does Obama think he has his life together? (Does anyone?)</li>
			<li>What would Debussy think of modular synths?</li>
			<li>How many bananas could you fit in your house?</li>
			<li>What's the most important homework assignment I've ever done?</li>
			<li>Which random thing I've posted to the internet is most likely to make it into a history textbook?</li>
			<li>Are neural networks really the best way? Is there a much more efficient alternative to modern machine learning that we've just totally missed?</li>
			<li>How exactly does language work? Why is linguistic relativism so well-documented? Why is it that you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgFdics3uKo">train kids</a> to have perfect pitch just by giving them the language to describe it?</li>
			<li>How can we teach game design to kids?</li>
			<li>How would the defining composers of eras in Western art music (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, etc.) think about how we discuss their music today? How would Bach feel about us meticulously learning his improvised works note-for-note?</li>
			<li>What inefficiencies are there in the human body? Is there an alternate physiology that would be much more efficient?</li>
			<li>What do animals think of human music?</li>
			<li>How was your day? (Yes, that's you, SPARC reader. Was it good? Bad? Mediocre? Do you have classes? Kids? These aren't questions, these are just pointless wonderings. I've always wondered what the person on the other side of the screen is thinking.)</li>
			<li>What kind of background do you have? What things in life led you to be reading these applications?</li>
			<li>What do you find worthwhile about reading these?</li>
			<li>What do you hope to impart to us applicants? What kind of journey do you want us to experience while filling this out?</li>
			<li>What exactly is string theory, and how does it explain things?</li>
			<li>What beautiful scenes would have existed on prehistoric Earth?</li>
			<li>What kind of gender-neutral equivalents can we use for sir, sister, mother, and so forth? (I know many exist, but how can we make any of them stick?)</li>
			<li>Someone in the world has sat on more chairs than anyone else. Who is it?</li>
			<li>What are the biggest problems in rendering and physical modeling, and why are they so hard? (I know this is publicly available information, but despite my efforts I still lack the background to fully answer this.)</li>
			<li>What kinds of movies could we make if they were solved?</li>
			<li>We all know the education system is broken. But what would work better?</li>
			<li>Suppose aliens were attacking earth, and all the world's leaders had to come together to fight like the power rangers. What would our army look like?</li>
			<li>If Xi Jingping and Trump did the fusion dance from Dragon Ball Z, what would their hidden ability be?</li>
			<li>What is the most-remembered comic panel of all time?</li>
			<li>At some point in history, someone had the largest poop of all time. How big was it, and what's the story behind it?</li>
			<li>In the history of music, there have probably been many amazing theories that have never seen the light of day. What's one that could be insightfully applied to a modern pop song?</li>
			<li>Similarly, who is the best philosopher whom we'll never hear about?</li>
			<li>What does a prehistoric fruit taste like? (Doesn't have to be the tastiest one, just any one.)</li>
			<li>Why is sexual reproduction so prevalent? (The Red Queen Hypothesis endeavors to answer this question; I'm just not convinced.)</li>
			<li>What would Van Gogh, Monet, or Rembrandt think of modern digital art tools, like Photoshop?</li>
			<li>What would they create, were they given these tools?</li>
			<li>How does Shor's algorithm work? (Also something which is publicly available, but which I have yet to understand.)</li>
			<li>What words in other languages does English not have, but should?</li>
			<li>Do whales have an oral history? (They have no natural predators, live longer than nearly anything else, and have massive brains. They must, right?)</li>
			<li>What's the tastiest thing that no one's tried to eat yet?</li>
			<li>Who was the first person to try eating crabs?</li>
			<li>In some cultures, tomatoes are sweet; in others, they are savory. At some point in history, these cultures were probably not aware of one another. If you took one person from each culture and had them try each other's cuisine, what would happen?</li>
			<li>Why is it that beauty standards tend to lean towards being less healthy as time goes on?</li>
			<li>What things could we easily discover about the universe, if science had unlimited funding?</li>
			<li>What exactly is gluten? How does working dough give it more gluten, and how the heck to Chinese people manage to extract it and fry it?</li>
			<li>How are memories stored? Chronologically? Conceptually? Neither?</li>
			<li>What's the best idea that I've forgotten?</li>
			<li>How the heck do cockroaches make it to my closed room on the 15th floor?</li>
			<li>Does the tonality of certain languages (Chinese, Shona, etc.) affect how their speakers perceive pitch? (Or something else?)</li>
			<li>Similarly, does the speaking of clicking languages affect how their speakers perceive rhythm? (Or something else?)</li>
			<li>I've read that ancient older fruits and vegetables weren't as tasty as the ones we have now. I've also read that these plants reproduce by being eaten. So why, after billions of years of development, were they not tasty?</li>
			<li>How were Katie Bouman and co. able to take a picture of a black hole using imperfect data?</li>
			<li>I've always thought the LHC experiments were somehow childish. How do we figure out how atoms work? By smashing them. Is there a more elgant way to do so?</li>
			<li>On the contrary, what more could we find out the world by smashing things?</li>
			<li>How do Youtube to MP3 converters work?</li>
			<li>Why do we sometimes suddenly shiver when we pee?</li>
			<li>Why did I used to be so convinced that I had an imaginary friend? Why does anyone believe in imaginary friends?</li>
			<li>Somewhere on the planet, one person has an imaginary friend that is exactly like another person. What would be like for these two people to meet?</li>
			<li>I've been told before that if we, for example, put pizza boxes into a paper recycling bin, the whole lot will have to be thrown out. But in those massive recycling bins outside of apartments, I'm sure at least one person has made a mistake. How do recycling centers sort through all of them?</li>
			<li>GÃ¶del showed that any set of axioms must have unprovable propositions. We all have a set of axioms that we internally create, whether we are aware of them or not. For instance, a Christian person might fundamentally believe that God exists. What are my axioms?</li>
			<li>Also, what's unproveable in my axioms?</li>
			<li>Currently, the only way we can run cryptocurrencies is by essentially downloading a massive file to everyone's computer. Is a more elegant design we're simply overlooking?</li>
			<li>What would dinosaur meat taste like?</li>
			<li>Why does nearly every musical culture in the world follow (mostly) the same diatonic harmony patterns?</li>
			<li>And in thes that don't, why not?</li>
			<li>I've noticed that small animals seem to take injuries better. Some birds can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxGuNJ-nEYg">jump off cliffs</a> and feel nothing at all. Why?</li>
			<li>What's the best game I've never played?</li>
			<li>What's the most-played board game or card game in all of human history?</li>
			<li>Someone in history invented the first board game. What kind of background did they have?</li>
			<li>Humans get aroused from seeing other humans naked. Do other animals not do the same, when they're always naked?</li>
			<li>How the heck does spectral graph theory work? It seems like sorcery...</li>
			<li>What defines whether a cellular automata is "interesting" or not? How can we classify "interesting" cellular automata?</li>
			<li>Why does the internet look like and work the way it does? Was it an arbitrary design? Are there better designs?</li>
			<li>Why can't we tickle ourselves, but we can masturbate?</li>
			<li>What is the best but least-read book?</li>
			<li>We could write a 10,000-word story out of 10,000 books by taking the 1st word from the 1st book, the 2nd word from the 2nd book, and so on. What ordered set of 10,000 books would make the best story?</li>
			<li>What portion of the things we say throughout the day have never been said before ever, in the history of humankind?</li>
			<li>Why do the laundry machines at my dorm break down every day or so? Clearly people know how to fix them, so why won't they stop them from breaking? If they simply can't, then what is it that we're doing that causes them to stop working?</li>
			<li>If you could say exactly one thing to any one person in history, who would it be and what would you say?</li>
			<li>Personally, I feel like AR hasn't had any products that really need AR as a base technology. For instance, Pokemon Go is the largest AR app, but most people just disable the AR. What will the first great AR product look like?</li>
			<li>What's the mean and standard deviation for the word count of SPARC applications?</li>
			<li>Did you enjoy reading this?</li>
